Kennedy Space Centre, staying with my friend Ron Caswell. This is undoubtedly the most famous spaceport in the world and is named for the American President who set the landing and safe return of a man on the moon within the decade of the 1960s as a national goal in a speech to Congress on May 25th, 1961 (MP3 audio file). In the photo at left I am standing in front of Pad 39B. This is one of two pads (see also thumbnail below of Pad 39A) built back in the 1960's originally for the Saturn V moon rocket, and refurbished to accommodate the Space Shuttle in the late 1970s. Interestingly, the pad that launches the Soviet space shuttle, Energia Buran, has a similar history, having originally been built to launch the long secret Soviet moon rocket, the N-1.</p>

We witnessed the successful launch of Ariane V-61 (an Ariane 44LP rocket) at night, which placed two satellites into orbit.</p>

                    <p class="lead card-text text-shadow text-white w-50 hidden-md-down"> I drove down the west coast from my home in Vancouver Canada to tour several space-related facilities in California. One of the highlights of that trip was a visit to America's busiest spaceport, Vandenberg Air Force Base near Lompoc California, just north of Santa Barbara on the coast. This launch site is a military installation from which many spy satellites are placed in a polar orbit. A polar orbit is best for overflying most of the Earth's surface in a relatively short period of time (as the Earth rotates below at 90 degrees to the satellite track), which is important for reconnaissance missions. Once again, I am very glad I took this tour when I did because this facility had never, so far as I am aware, been available for public tours before this time (1996) and now, in this post-911 world, I expect it is closed to the general public once again. </p>

(for an MP3 audio interview about the New Horizons mission from January 2006 click here This was just five months after our dear friend and fellow "Baikonour Boy" Butch Head met an untimely death in an auto accident and Butch was truly there in spirit throughout our time together. In fact, the Atlas V 500 with the New Horizon's spacecraft was supposed to be launched on January 17th but was scrubbed that day and the next and finally launched on January 19th. As Bob McCullough noted, it was Butch's way of keeping us together a bit longer.</p>

In June of 2009 I was fortunate to visit Peenemunde on the Baltic coast in northeastern Germany, which was the site of the development of the "A-4" rocket, better known as the "V-2", the first large ballistic missile which was developed during the Second World War by the team led by Dr. Wernher von Braun. The V-2 is agruably the most important development in the history of rocketry, since subsequent rockets developed after the war by the two superpowers, both the USSR and the USA, can trace their heritage very directly to the V-2. In fact, many American vehicles developed in the 1950s and 1960s (e.g., the Redstone, Jupiter and Saturn series) were designed by von Braun's team, culminating in the Saturn V which took the first men to the Moon at the end of the '60s. </p>
